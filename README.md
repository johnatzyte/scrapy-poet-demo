# Scrapy Web Poet Addon

Demo Project

```uv init```
```uv add scrapy scrapy-web-poet scrapy-zyte-api zyte-common-items```

this sample project demonstrates how to use Scrapy Web Poet to scrape data from websites. It takes a simple spider and creates two page objects, one for the product page and one for the list page.

Scrapy Web-Poet integration is achieved by using the Page Object pattern. This pattern allows us to encapsulate the logic for parsing a web page into a separate class, making our code more modular and easier to maintain.
